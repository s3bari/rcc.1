<p class="style1">The Hobby Computer Club was officially established in Oct. 2006 and
is open to everyone who has some background in programming, be it C, C++, Java, etc.
You don't necessarily have to be in an Engineering program to be a member. As long as
you show a keen interest in what we do and what we aim to achieve, you should be fine.</p>

<!--<p class="style1">Our objective is to develop your programming skills along the course
of your years at Ryerson, eventually giving you the knowledge to be able to design and
develop 3D games.  We will be employing various tools such as OpenGL and 3D StudioMax
to build your skills as a programmer, starting with the basic fundamentals, and working
our way up to the more advanced (and cooler!) concepts and design methodologies.</p>
<p class="style1">Don't forget, we cater to you as a member. We will teach you what
you need to know for game designing, rendering and all that awesome 3D stuff.
We are here to help you develop as a programmer because remember...we're cool
like that!</p>
