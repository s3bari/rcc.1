First of all, we just want to wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2007. We hope you enjoyed the break, and are ready to get back to the grind. We finally had our first HCC meeting this semester and decided on a few things that we'll be carrying out over the next few weeks. First off, we will be having our 'Welcome Back' info session on Jan. 31st 2007 (venue and time TBA). This will highlight what we aim to accomplish this semester and hopefully gain some recognition in the Ryerson community. We will also talk about upcoming events, our new website and the HCC logo contest. Finally, we will carry out a short survey in the end, just so we can get some feedback from you, regarding the HCC. We hope to see you there.<br />

<b>P.S. There will also be FREE pizza and refreshments available.</b> </p>
