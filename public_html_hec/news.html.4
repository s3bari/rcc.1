<p>


Over the last two moths the HEC has been working hard on a new project. We have 
become well equated with the Xof1 Solar car team and now have position of their 
solar car at the school in EPH 100 where we work weekly on it preparing it for a 
world record breaking trip this summer. We encourage all to come out during the 
regular HEC meeting night Tuesdays from 5:00 till 9:00 as well as a new meeting 
night dedicated strictly for the solar car that is held on Thursdays from 5:00 
till 9:00. We welcome anyone who would like to learn, and or work on the car to 
help us out.<br>
<br>
Next week the HEC executive is going to start promoting the club by making 
announcements during various lectures. We would like to replenish the HEC with 
new members before the summer starts. The summer, as it did last year, offers a 
great deal of extra time for most students and is a perfect opportunity to get 
involved. We will be holding one more meetings this year, before exams, in order 
to get the HEC’s events planned for the summer. We would like for all members 
who still show up and those of you who have been tied up with school to show up 
during these times in order to help us plan the events and projects you would 
like to see happen over the summer and into next semester.<br>
<br>
Next week (Thursday April 4th) we will meet at the regular HEC lab time (5:00 
PM). But we will meet in EPH 100 instead of our HEC lab room. This is not a 
permanent change, since the EPH 100 room will be taken away from use at the end 
of May. We will inform you as to where we will meet each week. <br>
<br>
Please check the website each week as we will be using it more often. We will 
try to have the site updated every Monday morning. We are unable to update the 
site on weekends due to the security restriction level of the HEC account on the 
network, but it doesn’t take long to take a quick peak.<br>

The date and time to meet with the Xof1 solar car team has finally been

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">HEC would like to invite all the members to a 
presentation by the Xof1 solar car team. They are a non profit, privately owned team 
that has been working over the past few years building a solar car. Their intention 
is to make it into the Guinness book of world records by breaking the distance record
for solar car travel. We intend to help them reach this goal by working out some of 
the bugs in their systems, and at the same time learn a great deal from them.<br>
The first step in this journey will be the presentation (time and place stated below). 
This presentation is geared towards the general public, and is open to all, however, 
it will provide us with a good opportunity to meet with the members of Xof1 and hear 
some of their problems they would like our help with.<br> Please note this is a 
general information session which will give a brief introduction to their project. 
This information session is open for all.<br><br> Where: KHE127<br> 

When: Nov. 17th from 4:30-6:15pm<br> 
Who is invited: EVERYONE FROM RYERSON IN ANY DEPARTMENT<br><br><br> 
This weeks HEC lab session will be a general lab. We will have some students there who 
are familiar with PIC chips put on a small presentation about them. We will also be 
programming them. Sparky will also have a few small projects and a tip or trick of 
the week to teach.</font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This week's lab will consist of a 
continuation to last week's turotial on Oscilloscopes. The Oscilloscope tutorial 
was not completed since the majority of members had to leave the session early 
due to heavy work load.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>


<p>


<b>October 17, 2005</b> <font color="#FF0000">Announcement</font></p>


<p>


<font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This weeks lab tutorial is being changed 
form Oscilloscopes to a tutorial on how to read data sheets.&nbsp; This change was 
made due to the fact that week 7 is a very heavy load for the majority of 
engineering.&nbsp; We hope that you still will join us even just for an hour or two.&nbsp; 
The following week we will have the tutorial on Oscilloscopes and the following 
week we will learn about various IC-chips and circuits that our available such 
as accelerometers,&nbsp; gyros, temperature sensors, etc.&nbsp; If we do not see you 
during next weeks lab, we would like to take this opportunity to wish you luck 
on your exams and look forward to seeing you again the following week.</font></p>

This weeks lab will consist of a lesson in soldering.&nbsp; We will be building FM 
transmitters following the lesson in order to practice our new skills.&nbsp; We will 
also be taking some time to analyze the circuit and recognize various parts that 
combine to form the transmitter.</p>

Hello everyone, this is a reminder that there will be no HEC lab in the first 
week of school. When we have the opportunity to book the labs we will be 
updating you on the new time(s) of the HEC labs.<br>
<br>
For those of you who were interested we do have a solar car meeting Monday 
September 6<sup>th</sup> at 5pm. We are going to meet in front of ENG303. If you

GREAT news!!!

We were able to get lab access for HEC over the summer!!!
 
Our first lab will be Tuesday July 5th at 5pm in ENG303. We will start off by having a general meeting to discuss how the club will be run over the summer. 
After the meeting we will be attempting to make a device that will use a solar panel to power an mp3 player. We also urge you to bring in a project 
of your own to work on. It can be anything from a broken stereo lying around the house to a schematic diagram of device you want to make.

Greetings HEC members.  We hope that exams are going well for everyone.  Most of us should be almost done by now and are starting to think about the summer. 
We have been working on getting summer hours and we have been asked to hold requests till after the fourth years thesis open house mid May.  So basically, we 
will not be granted access till at least that time.  I guarantee most of you will want a week or two break anyhow to find summer jobs, or just relax from 
a stressful last month or so.  The members page has been updated.  We are still planning on doing a PIC theme for the first few weeks during the summer, 
assuming we are given access.  
<p>
If you would like to attend the open house, its on May 4th 2005, from 3:30pm till 8:30pm.  That is the only information I was able to find about it in a 
quick search.
<p>
If there are any questions or concerns please feel free to e-mail us at any time.  The e-mail is checked every day and replies are sent ASAP.  Thank you for 
your patience and good luck on the rest of your exams.
<p>

Due to the final exams the HEC labs will be canceled for the next few weeks untill exams are finished.  We will however be in the lab this 
Monday for anyone who wishes to use the equipment or meet with the executive.  We are currently working on setting up a presentation on PIC chips.  We will be working with these microprocessors for the next month after exams as long as acess to the lab during the summer is 
approved.  You can read up on them from the provided link on the links page.

HEC’s First lab Date March 21st in Room ENG 303.  At 4:00PM till 9:00PM
<p>

We will be discussing a few simple projects we can complete by Exam time, and also be talking about any lectures or topics you would like covered for the next lab period.  We will also go into more detail as to what we expect from you and how small projects will be handled compared to larger projects which require excessive funding.  There will be no parts supplied at this time as funds have not been received. We hope to obtain some funding within the month, however this is not a promises.  If you wish to start something on your own, you may bring in your own supplies.  Have a look on our links page for some simple circuit ideas.  See you there!

Hello HEC members and Potential members.  I would like to stress two things that have come to my attention through e-mails.  
<p>
First point, this club is not solely electronics in nature.  Be aware computer engineers, that we will be doing a lot of programming of various Micro controllers, PLC’s, robotics, etc.  However, this might not start till the summer as funding for these types of projects would be high, and we have not received any as of yet.
<p>
Second point, is that we are not accepting anyone outside the Comp. Or Elec. Engineering programs. For more information on this please visit out Link “About HEC”.
