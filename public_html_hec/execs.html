<h1><u>The Executives</u></h1>
Here are the executives of the Hobby Electronics Club (HEC).
<p><br><p>

<h3><img border="0" src="images/profile/Shane.jpg" align="middle" width="150" height="150"> President: Shane Harris</h3>

Shane Harris is an Honors Graduate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Technology (Mechtronics) from Durham College, in Oshawa (2001).  His hard work and drive has earned him a place on the deans list at Ryerson as well.  He was a former-member of the RESS executive, and has represented Ryerson at OEC at the University of Western Ontario, in First Year Team Design in February 2003 and at The University of Waterloo, in his Third year February 2005.  He has also participated in orientation week (Frosh week) in 2004 as an executive frosh leader.  His outstanding participation in school activities has shown that he is extremely enthusiastic in his ambitions to leave his mark, making a positive change to the existing University society as we know it,  during his stay at Ryerson.  
<p>
Interestingly, he has extensive knowledge in automation controls, including PLCs, robotics, digital and electronic circuits, as well as Fluid control systems, extending from the traditional Ryerson teachings in electronics.  He is also talented with the mechanical aspect of manufacturing and design in that he possesses experience with a college background in metal fabrication using mills, lathes, drill presses and other various tools.  Shane has also gained a wealth of practical knowledge from his experiences working in the field for one year as a pneumatics control technician, at Supreme Tooling, where he not only provided pneumatic control to hundreds of machines, but programmed Omron PLC’s as well as assembling robotic cells for automation assembly lines.
<p>
During his spare time he enjoys wakeboarding, skiing/snowboarding, ski doing, working out, flying airplanes and playing guitar with a band he is trying to form with friends.  He also enjoys helping his best friend with his race car during the summer months.

<h3><img border="0" src="images/profile/Mike.jpg" align="middle" width="150" height="150"> Vice President: Michael Hall</h3>

Michael (Mike) Hall is one of the better students at Ryerson when it comes to electronic labs.  Mike obtained his practical knowledge through his rigorous electronics and robotics courses at his former-highschool, where he has obtained 2 awards for finishing with the top mark in his class. 
<p>
In addition to this experience, Mike has also participated at a successful OEC competition, in February 2003 and has volunteered as a froshleader for the last 2 years. As a froshleader Mike has had a chance to meet with large amount of the electrical and computer engineering students and can act as familiar face to HECs new members.  In fact, Mike is one of the more respectable, responsible characters anybody could ever meet.  His positive attitude and practical experience in electronics would be of interest to the HEC.

<h3><img border="0" src="images/profile/Paolo.jpg" align="middle" width="150" height="150"> VP Finance: Paolo Auciello</h3>

Paolo was a former-member of the RESS Executive.  As well, he participated at a successful OEC competition in February of 2003.  His experience in teamwork, engineering design philosophy, and administrative experience would make him a strong candidate for the executive.

<h3><img border="0" src="images/profile/Sparky.jpg" align="middle" width="150" height="150"> Lab Co-ordinator: Bryan Stuurman</h3>

Bryan Stuurman possesses one of the most brilliant minds Ryerson has ever seen.  He combines practical and theoretical knowledge together with his handyman capabilities.  Bryan is an expert at analog and digital electronics, along with auto mechanics; he is capable of fixing almost anything.  He also fixes broken computers and electronics during his spare time, and is an electronics guru in his own right.   He is famous for his inter-disciplinary engineering knowledge, in his applications.
<p>
He participates in “figure-8” races at town fairs across Ontario every summer; these races consist of broken-down cars that have been rehabilitated to race around in a confined figure-8 track, where body contact of cars is allowed and often encouraged by the crowd.  Interestingly, he has done very well in these races.
<p>
Bryan’s sublime talent is a clear indication that he would be a helpful member for the HEC executive; however, his uncanny willingness to help his classmates 
understand concepts makes him even more vital.  Without a doubt, his encouraging outlook and Edison-like abilities would be an asset to the HEC.
