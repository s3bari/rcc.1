			<strong>Ryerson HCC <a href="projects.html">LEAP</a> Guide</strong>
			<p>
			Getting started with Ryerson HCC's Linux distribution is simple. Since it is still in the process of being built, learning what we have done so far will put you in phase with our project. I will be updating this page with the progress that we make to try and keep all our members on the same page. 		
			</p>
			<p>
				We started with creating two partitions on our master tower to hold:
				<ul>
					<li>host operating system whose tools we used to help build some of the components of our distribution</li>
					<li>operating system that's being built and all its required files,</li>
				</ul>
				Having a workspace, we copied over the required packages and patches provided by LFS. Then we created a <i>tools</i> directory which holds the tools required to build the LFS system but will not be part of the final build. We also created a user called LFS which would be used to build the system since using root could damage the host system in case of a mistake. 
			</p>
			<p>
			That's where we left at the end of Fall 2009. We'll be resuming in Winter 2010 to continue building the packages in to our system. Documentation pertaining to working with the system is available during meetings. Do come and join!
